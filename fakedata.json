Located in the southwestern part of the country, and part of the storied Chittagong Hill Tracts, the Bandarban district holds enough magic to do the trick. In this article, we are going to focus on the best places to see and the craziest things to do in Bandarban.",
        "Description_Two": "During the monsoon season, the weather of Bandarban feels warm with good chances for rain. Tourists hardly visit Bandarban in these months. If you are looking for deals and offers at resorts and hotels, take the chance. However, during the rainy season the Hill Tracts region including Bandarban Hill District runs the risk of landslides, which can hinder the local transportation system for days.",
        "Description_Three": "Due to the nice weather with very small chances of rainfall, Winter is the best as well as the busiest season for tourism in Bandarban. The charges of hotels and resorts usually increase during this period."

        "Description_One": "Saint Martin's Island is one of the most admired tourist places that get into the itinerary of travelers while planning long tours inside Bangladesh. This is the only coral island in the southernmost part of the mainland of Bangladesh, awake with the wonder of thousands of tourists. 9-km south of Teknaf in Cox's Bazar, at the estuary of the Naf River, this small island is proudly announcing its existence with an area of only 3 sq-km. The travel feature is created this time with details of this place of interest. Let’s have them.",
        "Description_Two": "At first, flying and playing in the foamy sea of white Gangchils on the sea route from Teknaf to Saint Martin island will give you an intro to the upcoming endless joys. Although it consists of seven different neighborhoods, each of them is woven in a single thread-like pearl necklace. In the afternoon with a cup of tea, you can witness the best sunset of your life from the west coast of the island. There is no alternative to West Beach to dive into Saint Martin. Spend the morning on East Beach. East Beach takes on a magical look when the first rays of the sun catch your eyes by climbing the mountains of Myanmar. Chheradwip is formed by relying on corals in the southernmost part of the island. It is called Chheradip because it gets separated from the main island during the monsoon season. In addition to sea and sunbathing, Saint Martin is also a great place for scuba diving, snorkeling, and barbecue. If you don’t stay there for at least one day, you will have to come back with lots of regrets.",
        "Description_Three": "Ships usually sail from Teknaf during these five months from November to March or April. For other times, you have to use trawlers or speedboats. Moreover, the sea is rough at times other than winter. Therefore, it is comparatively safer to travel Saint Martin's Island during the winter season."

        "Description_One": "The Maldives are an island nation in the Indian Ocean. They are in southern Asia near the equator. There are some 1,200 coral islands, or atolls, distributed north to south across the Indian Ocean like a pearl necklace strung by the heavens. Of these islands, some 200 of them are large enough to be inhabited by people. One hundred islands currently house a single high-end resort hotel that takes up the entire space of the island. The brilliant blue sea, the white sandy beach and the sparkling sunshine undoubtedly are what makes the Maldives synonymous with the idea of a honeymoon in paradise.",
        "Description_Two": "Every resort in Maldives is its own private island, and with over 100 to choose from the only problem is selecting where you want to stay. At the top end, the world’s most exclusive hotel brands compete with each other to attain ever-greater heights of luxury, from personal butlers and private lap pools to in-room massages and pillow menus. It’s not surprising that honeymooners and those seeking a glamorous tropical getaway have long had the country at the very top of their wish lists. But there’s also plenty of choice beyond the five- and six-star resorts.",
        "Description_Three": "With some of the best diving and snorkeling in the world, the clear waters of Maldives are a magnet for anyone with an interest in marine life. The richness and variety is astonishing; dazzling coral walls, magnificent caves and schools of brightly colored tropical fish await you when you get down to the reef. In deeper waters lurk manta rays, turtles, sharks and even the world’s largest fish, the whale shark. The best bit? The water is so warm many people don’t even wear a wetsuit."

Whether you experience it in a state of full bloom come spring/summer, or bear witness to its ensorcelling winter beauty, there’s always magic to partake of in Kashmir.",
        "Description_Two": "Starting at the capital always bodes well; and the arresting scapes of Srinagar have plenty of wonderful places you could temporarily call home. There’s the Vivanta Dal View, Srinagar, decadent in its sprawling Kralsangri hill estate and wintertime views of the snow-tipped peaks of the Zabarwan range, best enjoyed over private dinners or over kahwa at the tea lounge. The LaLiT Grand Palace, Srinagar, is also deliciously opulent, ensconced as it is by the glimmering lake and the Himalayas. Their restaurant, The Chinar, is famously considered one of the foremost in Kashmir.",
        "Description_Three": "If you’re after something more authentically Kashmiri, Mascot Houseboats make for a great change of pace. Moored near the clear waters of Nageen Lake, these old-school houseboats give you a five-star experience–on the water. You can get boats that go up to five bedrooms, so it's fairly large-family friendly. When you move to Gulmarg, The Khyber Himalayan Resort & Spa should factor high on your list of bases–for its magnificent setting (8,825 feet above sea level in the Pir Panjal Range of the Himalayas), Spa by L’Occitane and golf course (the world’s highest)."
